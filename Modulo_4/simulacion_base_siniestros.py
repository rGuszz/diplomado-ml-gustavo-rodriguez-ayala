"""Synthetic multiconcept monthly triangle database generator.

Generates a long-format database with four related concepts:
  Exposure, Earned Premium, Claims Reported, Loss Incurred.

Dependency structure:
  Final Exposure
      ├── Final Earned Premium     (correlated via premium rate)
      └── Ultimate Claims Reported (correlated via frequency * exposure)
               └── Ultimate Loss Incurred (correlated via severity * claims)

Simulation flow:
  1. Simulate final Exposure per accident period.
  2. Simulate final Earned Premium from Exposure × premium rate.
  3. Simulate ultimate Claims Reported from Exposure × claim frequency.
  4. Simulate ultimate Loss Incurred from Claims × average severity.
  5. Apply concept-specific development curves to produce triangle cells.
  6. Flatten all cells to the project long-format database schema.

Final accident-period quantities are simulated first; triangle cells are derived
from those quantities via development curves, not simulated independently.

Exposure and Earned Premium use a cancellation/audit-adjustment interpretation:
the value at dev_0 is an initial booked estimate; successive development periods
reflect downward revisions from cancellations, endorsements, and audit adjustments.
Development factors for these two concepts are therefore below one.

Claims Reported and Loss Incurred use a conventional non-decreasing cumulative
pattern. Claims develop materially faster than Loss Incurred.

    """Generate a synthetic long-format multiconcept monthly triangle database.

    Model construction:
        Final quantities (ultimate exposure, premium, claims, loss) are simulated
        once per accident period, incorporating trend, seasonality, and random
        variation.  Triangle cells are derived from those quantities by applying
        logistic development curves (Claims, Loss) or exponential cancellation
        curves (Exposure, Premium).

    Concept interpretation:
        Exposure and Earned Premium: initial booked estimates that decline toward
        the final audited value as cancellations and adjustments are processed.
        Development factors are below 1.0.

        Claims Reported and Loss Incurred: cumulative counts and amounts that grow
        toward ultimate values.  Development factors are above 1.0.

    Development conventions:
        dev_0 is the first observable value: the initial booked amount for Exposure
        and Earned Premium, and the first recognised claims or losses for Claims
        Reported and Loss Incurred.  Development proceeds in monthly steps.
        Only cells on or below the latest observable diagonal are included.

    Relationship structure:
        Exposure → Earned Premium  (typically r ≈ 0.96–0.98): both share the
            Exposure base; independent premium rate noise reduces correlation from 1.0.
        Exposure → Claims Reported (typically r ≈ 0.15–0.25): indirect causal
            link; NegBinomial frequency dispersion adds substantial variation.
        Claims Reported → Loss Incurred (typically r ≈ 0.75–0.85): direct causal
            link; per-AP severity shock adds moderate variation.

    Return schema:
        Standard 9-column long-format DataFrame:
        concept, basis, amount_type, level_1, level_2, level_3,
        accident_period, development_period, amount.
        All amounts are positive. Row count = 4 × (n × (n+1) / 2) where
        n = config.n_accident_months.

    Safe classroom parameter changes:
        Adjusting base levels, trend rates, seasonal amplitudes, or noise sigmas
        changes the appearance of the data without affecting model structure.
        Change the seed to explore variability across different random draws.
        Avoid changing n_accident_months, n_dev_periods, or start_accident_period
        during a first demonstration — these alter triangle dimensions and row count.
